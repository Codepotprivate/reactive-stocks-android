During this workshop we will demonstrate API and techniques which can be applied to develop a reactive application for highly concurrent Android Environment. This workshop will not be focused on the Reactive Manifesto academic aspects, but on how to apply the concepts in real life application. Beginning with standard Android SDK, moving to 3rd party libraries, we will explore various methods of asynchronous computation based on event communication. This will allow you to learn the pros and cons of various approaches to develop Android apps. 
Instead of going deep into technical aspects how those mechanisms work, we will present how to use those APIs.
Within the scope we will develop an application using Android Rx, different methods to implement event bus pattern. 
To create more concise code we will employ Retrolambda plugin.
The attendee for this workshop should have basic knowledge of Android platform.

Requirements:
Bring your laptop with stable release of Android Studio.
Mobile device with Android operating system.
USB cable to connect device to your machine.
Installed Java SDK version 7 and 8.
